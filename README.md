# Fluent Python Journey

This repository documents my learning journey through **Fluent Python (2nd Edition)** by Luciano Ramalho.

The focus of this project is to understand Python at a deeper level how the language works, why certain patterns exist, and how to write clear, idiomatic, and expressive Python code. The work here is centered around experiments, small exercises, and lightweight projects inspired by the book.

This is not a beginner repository. It is meant as a hands-on exploration of Python’s core features, design philosophy, and advanced concepts, with an emphasis on thinking in Python rather than just using it.

The repository will evolve gradually as I progress through the book.

Python version used: **3.12**
